# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
Using the original data from the Green Stock Analysis, the project calls to refactor the code within the Visual Basic Application in Excel. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to refactor the data and determine whether the data was correctly reported during both methods, but also if it was more efficiently produced during refactoring or prior coding in VBA. 

## Analysis and Results

### Analysis
Upon completion of the refactoring of the green stock analysis, results showed that the refactored process was indeed a more efficient path to the findings for both years.

-2017 was a better return year overall with many tickers returning positive percentages.
*Time elapsed (to compare to original VBA script: 0.734375 seconds for 2017)

-2018 stocks had mostly negative return percentages.

*Time elapsed (to compare to original VBA script: 0.6953125 seconds for 2018)

### Advantages and Disadvantages
Working with both the original VBA script and the refactored coding, there are many similarities, but also a few differences. In my experience, the refactored coding seemed a little more in depth to enter, however it obviously produced results quicker and more efficiently. Using a tickerIndex created some confusion when crafting the refactored code so that acted as a small hindrance. However, once I became used to using the index when necessary, it was more efficient.
